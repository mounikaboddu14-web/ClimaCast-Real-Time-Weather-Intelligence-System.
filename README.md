Project overview

ClimaCast (Real-Time Weather Dashboard) is a Python-based desktop application that combines OpenWeatherMap API, Tkinter GUI, and 
Matplotlib visualization to provide users with real-time weather updates and forecast analysis.

The program allows users to:

--> Enter a city name.

--> Retrieve current weather (temperature, humidity, condition).

--> Display a 12-hour forecast.

--> Plot a 5-day temperature trend using Matplotlib.

It demonstrates API integration, JSON handling, GUI design, and data visualization — all within a single desktop application.

🖥️ Features

1.Real-time temperature, humidity, and conditions display

2.12-hour forecast listing

3.5-day temperature trend graph

4.Error handling for invalid inputs

5.Responsive, user-friendly GUI

🔮 Future Scope

--> Add geolocation detection

--> Visualize additional metrics (wind, pressure, rainfall)

--> Enable multi-city comparison

--> Cloud data storage for historical analysis

-->Extend to mobile/web apps and add alert notifications

The below are the advantages and disadvantages of the Climacast

| **Aspect**         | **Advantages**                              | **Disadvantages**                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Data Source**    | Real-time from API                          | Requires Internet                |
| **Interface**      | Easy and intuitive                          | Visually basic                   |
| **Functionality**  | Accurate and responsive                     | Limited forecast range           |
| **Learning Value** | Demonstrates Python APIs, GUI, and plotting | None (educationally valuable)    |
| **Scalability**    | Easily extendable                           | No geolocation or mobile support |
| **Performance**    | Lightweight and fast                        | Dependent on API speed           |
