Project Overview

ClimaCast (Real-Time Weather Dashboard) is a Python-based desktop application that combines OpenWeatherMap API, Tkinter GUI, and 
Matplotlib visualization to provide users with real-time weather updates and forecast analysis.

The program allows users to:

--> Enter a city name.

--> Retrieve current weather (temperature, humidity, condition).

--> Display a 12-hour forecast.

--> Plot a 5-day temperature trend using Matplotlib.

It demonstrates API integration, JSON handling, GUI design, and data visualization — all within a single desktop application.
